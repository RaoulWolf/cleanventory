\description{
The EC inventory published below is a copy as received from the
  JRC in 2008 on the founding of ECHA. It is comprised of the following
  lists:

  EINECS (European INventory of Existing Commercial chemical Substances) as
  published in O.J. C 146A, 15.6.1990. EINECS is an inventory of substances
  that were deemed to be on the European Community market between 1 January
  1971 and 18 September 1981. EINECS was drawn up by the European Commission
  in the application of Article 13 of Directive 67/548/EEC, as amended by
  Directive 79/831/EEC, and in accordance with the detailed provisions of
  Commission Decision 81/437/EEC. Substances listed in EINECS are considered
  phase-in substances under the REACH Regulation.

  ELINCS (European LIst of Notified Chemical Substances) in support of
  Directive 92/32/EEC, the 7th amendment to Directive 67/548/EEC. ELINCS
  lists those substances which were notified under Directive 67/548/EEC, the
  Dangerous Substances Directive Notification of New Substances (NONS) that
  became commercially available after 18 September 1981.

  NLP (No-Longer Polymers).  The definition of polymers was changed in April
  1992 by Council Directive 92/32/EEC amending Directive 67/548/EEC, with
  the result that substances previously considered to be polymers were no
  longer excluded from regulation. Thus the No-longer Polymers (NLP) list
  was drawn up, consisting of such substances that were commercially
  available between 18 September 1981 and 31 October 1993.
