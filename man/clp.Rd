\description{
ECHA has prepared an excel table containing all updates to the
  harmonised classification and labelling of hazardous substances, which are
  available in Table 3 of Annex VI to the CLP Regulation.

  The harmonised classification and labelling of hazardous substances is
  updated through an "Adaptation to Technical Progress (ATP)" which is
  issued yearly by the European Commission. Following the adoption of the
  opinion on the harmonised classification and labelling of a substance by
  the Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC), the European Commission takes a
  decision and publishes the updated list in an ATP.
